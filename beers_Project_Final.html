					A Duvel is still seen as the reference among strong golden ales. Its bouquet is lively and tickles the nose with an element of citrus which even tends towards grapefruit thanks to the use of only the highest-quality hop varieties. This is also reflected in the flavour, which is beautifully balanced with a hint of spiciness. Thanks to its high CO2 content, this beer has a wonderful roundness in the mouth. A Duvel is both the perfect thirst quencher and the ideal aperitif.

					<p>Style: Special beer, re-fermented in the bottle</p>
					<p>Taste: Slightly fruity, dry aroma, well-hopped beer and with a slightly bitter aftertaste</p>	
					<p>Hops: Saaz-Saaz & Styrian Golding</p>
					<p>Appearance: Blond</p>
					<p>Shelf life: 24 months</p>
					<p>Serving Tips: Always serve in the tulip shaped Duvel glass at 5°C</p>

					In 1906, Laurent Huyghe bought the brewery where he had been working for four years. Though the brewery itself dates back to the 17th century, Delirium Tremens —its flagship beer with the pink elephant on the label— was first brewed on December 26, 1989. This Belgian Strong Golden Ale has potent aromas of alcohol and spice thanks to the complex blend of yeasts used to brew the beer.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					Chimay Yellow : Known by a couple of different names, this Belgian Tripel was created in 1966 (known as White Cap) and is brewed to a strength of 8% abv. This, I believe is now distributed in a white label bottle as well, which I recently purchased thinking it was a different beer but isn’t.

					<p>Aroma and Appearance: It pours a cloudy gold colour with some centered bubbles and one finger of foam. The aroma is clove, sweet pears, banana, herbs and hints of caramel.</p>

					<p>Flavour: This is a fairly sweet beer, with fruity pears up front and a super light effervescent body that brings out hints of caramel malt and spice in the middle. On the finish, there are notes of clove, more caramel and spicy herbs that get a little astringent as it goes down.</p>

					<p>Overall Impression: Pretty nice beer, very enjoyable and nicely mellowed over the two years.</p>

					<p>Rating: I give it an Excellent rating of 8/10, it is a high quality authentic Tripel.</p>

				<p>Péché Mortel (French for "Mortal Sin") is an intensely black and dense beer with very pronounced roasted flavours. Fair trade coffee is infused during the brewing process, intensifying the bitterness of the beer and giving it a powerful coffee taste. Péché mortel is brewed to be savored; we invite you to drink it in moderation.</p> 

				<p>This stout style, high in alcohol and bitterness in order to favour preservation, was historically brewed to support the long and arduous voyage necessary to export the beer from England to Russia. The word Imperial comes from the fact that the beer was specially brewed for the Russian tsar’s court.</p>

     			Originally introduced at the DDC! brewpub as a winter seasonal in January 2001, Blanche Neige – which translates to “Snow White” – is a Belgian-style wheat beer flavoured with cinnamon and clove, described as follows:
				<p>Blanche Neige isn’t your typical wheat beer.</p>
				<p> Firstly, the level of alcohol (9.5%) is surprising and is perceived rapidly both in the bouquet and in the mouth. The spices come through immediately, giving very little room for the usual wheat beer aromas (coriander and curaçao). Cinnamon and clove dominate and the flavours are generously well-rounded thanks no doubt to residual sugars. It is therefore a very sweet beer that is best appreciated slowly.</p>
